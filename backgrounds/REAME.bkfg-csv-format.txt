Background/Foreground image file formats and construction.

Looking in the "c:\OnSite\backgrounds" folders, you'll see repetitive files by the name of
background1.horz.psd, background1.vert.psd, etc.  These files contain two layers that 
sandwich the image being processed.  The top layer, named "foreground" is the overlay
on top and the background layer is for the greenscreen replacement. Anything that appears
on these layers will appear in the processed image. There can be up to four of these
files in a given layout folder; reason being, the animated GIFs use four image sequences.
The bkfg files become the foreground and background animation sequences when generating
a .GIF file. In the case of prints, you can have up to four different background/foreground 
combinations to offer your guests.

Due to the level of complexity of creating a custom set of layouts, it is recommended you
just modify the contents of an existing set of images in the layout folder. I recommend
layout folder "005" which gives you the entire set of horizontals and verticals. Save the
original files and then replace them with your own artwork. Just make sure your artwork
is the same x,y,dpi as the original set.  Also, make sure the layer names are the same;
"foreground" for the top layer, and "background" base layer. Since the foreground layer 
normally has transparencies, you will have to build a one pixel wide boarder around the 
edge for alignment purposes.  With your bk/fg file loaded in photoshop, select the 
"foreground" layer and execute "place border around current layer" found near the end
of the "Onsite.Printing" action set.

Delving Deeper..

The following will be a deeper examination of the bk/fg architecture. More documentation
coming soon.  For now, look at the "c:\OnSite\backgrounds\bkfglayouts.000" file. It is 
a comma delimited .CSV file describing all the features of the layouts. This file is
read by Pic2Print and certain pieces transfered to the Javascript for processing the
actions.
