background folder descriptions and contents:
============================================

All backgrounds/foregrounds are located in the following folder structure - folders named with 
three digit numbers. Here's the default list shipped in the baseline package -

     c:\OnSite\backgrounds\000
     c:\OnSite\backgrounds\001
     c:\OnSite\backgrounds\002
     c:\OnSite\backgrounds\003
     c:\OnSite\backgrounds\004

These three digit numbers constitute a collection. The most significant digit indicates the 
set, so 000 - 004 is the default set shipped with the package. The first add-on pack will be 
numbered 100 - 10x. The second add-on pack will be 200 - 20x, etc. That gives a possible 99
layouts per collection, more than you'd ever want.. 

Within each of these folders, may exist .PSD files, four per horizontal layout, four per
vertical layout, for a total of 8 files.  Ug, the explosion begins. Wait, it gets worse!

Within each of these numbered folders, can exist the 'ratio' folders, each containing the
8 .PSD files.  Lets see, thats 2 to the 6th power of files, per layout -
Possibly 5 folders for ratio files, then 4 verticals and 4 horizontals .PSD files for gifs 
& layout combos. Ug, that works out to a maximum possible 40 file layouts to cover all 
the orientations, print sizes and optional layouts.  The reality is, its fewer, by the 
power of bit fields!  There is a bit field found in the bkfglayouts.x00.csv files to enable 
each explosive step.  This way the combinations are controlled in the .csv file.

What are 'ratio' folders?  

In order to contain the explosion of combinations on layouts & print sizes, the 12 most 
common print sizes are translated into their X/Y ratio so to reduce the number of combinations. 
This allows the operator to create 5 sets of bk/fg files, not 12 sets. This is used in the case 
each print size must have its own unique layout, typically for cropping purposes.

The following table shows the translation:

    folder 125 = 4x5, 5x4, 8x10, 10x8 prints
    folder 133 = 3x4, 4x3, 6x8, 8x6 prints
    folder 140 = 3.5x5, 5x3.5, 5x7, 7x5 prints
    fodler 150 = 4x6, 6x4, 6x9, 9x6, 8x12, 12x8 prints
    folder 300 = 2x6, 6x2 photo strips

NOTE: These folders are OPTIONAL, and specified in the c:\onsite\software\bkfglayouts.x00.csv file.  
This file has the three digit collection number embedded in the name.  bgfglayouts.000.csv 
holds the default set, and bkfglayouts.100.csv will hold the first add-on pack layouts, etc. 

Don't panic if you don't see the ratio folders in your folders. it means the layouts work with the 
inherent cropping that occurs from the 6x4 down to the 10x8 format.  If you need to control the 
cropping, a custom action can be used before employing custom ratio files.  See the 003 collection 
custom actions in photoshop. The name of the actions is 'JS:003.Print.H:125' 

Add-on set 100, with layout # 103 contains an explosion of combinations for the first four layouts. 
This is due to the custom action required to crop and scale the layer into the frame.  Do a Git pull
of the Add-on set, then open the .PSD files to see whats up.
