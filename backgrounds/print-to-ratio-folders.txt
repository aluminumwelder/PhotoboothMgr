' The following table shows print sizes to aspect ratio.
' the actual folder names for the bg/fg layouts are named
' as ratios to keep the combinations down.  The software
' will know which folder to access based on the print 
' size selected. If the folder doesn't exist (like for the
' 2x6 print/ratio), the that format is not supported by
' the layout.
