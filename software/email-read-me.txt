            ----====< Pic2Print Email format instructions ver 14.08 >====----
            ----=========================================================----

The Pic2Print version 14.08 emailer now sends html emails. You may edit the file, 
"emailbody.html" anyway you like, and to add up to 5 images in the email. The 5 images
are in the repository, named "email_img01.jpg", etc.  You may edit/replace these
images, just keep the file names the same.  Pic2Print will automatically attach the 
event picture, and is accessable by its Content-ID name the same way as the mentioned
5 images. 

Attachements are named:

Content-ID variable name "img_01" will use "email_img01.jpg" within the email body,
Content-ID variable name "img_02" will use "email_img02.jpg" within the email body,
Content-ID variable name "img_03" will use "email_img03.jpg" within the email body,
Content-ID variable name "img_04" will use "email_img04.jpg" within the email body,
Content-ID variable name "img_05" will use "email_img05.jpg" within the email body,
Content-ID variable name "event_pic" is given to the attached user picture just processed by Pic2Print.

Here is an example html email with two of the picture attachments placed in the email:

     <html> 
     <title>testing html email</title>
     <body>

     <img src="cid:img_01" alt="company banner">

     Greetings!
 
     Here is your picture - <img src="cid:event_pic" alt="your picture"> 

     </body>
     </html>

An html editor is recommended to edit your email.
